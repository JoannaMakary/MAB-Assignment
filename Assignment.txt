With the excel file "example.xlsx", write a html file with the following requirements:

1. Write a function in javascript to parse the "Fitment Description" column of all the rows in the excel file into a variable with the following format:

2016|Kia    |Optima |- 305mm (12.01") Diameter Rotor
2017|Kia    |Optima |- 305mm (12.01") Diameter Rotor
2018|Kia    |Optima |- 305mm (12.01") Diameter Rotor
2018|Hyundai|Kona   |- 1.6 L4 Engine - 2.0 L4 Engine, AWD
2004|Honda  |Civic  |
etc.

2. Present this data as four dropdowns (Year, Make, Model, Notes). Each dropdown should constrain its options so that only parsed cars can be selected.

3. Use pure css to style dropdowns so that hovering over a dropdown makes it flash briefly while shaking slightly.
